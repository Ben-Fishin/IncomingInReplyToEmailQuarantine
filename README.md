# IncomingInReplyToEmailQuarantine
In-reply-to correlation bypass for forwarded mail

This snippet of code will prevent emails from being automatically promoted to Dynamics in the event that an email is attempted to be created due to in-reply-to correlation, but the recipients of the item do not match the original item being replied to. This behavior is most commonly seen when an email is forwarded to a different system user, and is unintentionally promoted to Dynamics.
